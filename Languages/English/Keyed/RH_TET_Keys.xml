	<RH_TET_GameOverChaosPortalGreatDestroyed>Congratulations! You've destroyed the great chaos portal. Well done! The old world will be safe for now, and Sigmar will have to wait a little longer before his new age rises.\n\nThis mod was developed by Johnny Hastings (@SickBoyWI). Special thanks to @Dino's Bar and Grill and @Rebelrot for the fantastic artwork they generously donated their time and skills for that went into this mod; it made up for my lack of graphics skills, and made the Rimhammer - The End Times mods that much more great.\n\nThank you for playing.\n\nYou're free to call it a win for now, or keep playing and see what else happens in the world. If that's the case, hit the escape key to return to the game.</RH_TET_GameOverChaosPortalGreatDestroyed>
